# APTraining
Developed with a group of 5 students during the Steacie Library Hackfest 2020. 

Using the Tensorflow open-source BodyPix library, APTraining provides real-time feedback while the user is performing an overhead press exercise. APTraining provides feedback via audio queues and text on the display. 

##Features 
1. Repetition Counter 
For each complete repetition done properly, increment the repetition counter on the screen. 

1. Live Feedback on overhead press form 
It is imperative that during an overhead press, both arms should reamin symetrical. 
A common mistake made during an overhead press is an imbalance of wrist heights. 
APTraining catches this mistake and provides live feedbback.
